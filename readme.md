- [Schematics](hw/tux_schematics.png)
- [BOM](hw/bom.md)

## FW

FW is based on [ch32v003fun](https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun) project. 

In `src` directory there are two projects: `demo` (test application fer testing HW functionality) and `simon` (tux says game).

### Compilation

1. Ch32v003fun is submodule of this project, so you have to clone it with `--recursive` option.
2. Follow [installation instruction](https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun/wiki/Installation) in ch32v003fun project.
3. Run `make` in `src/simon` directory.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**

In *simon* project there is cooperative multitasking scheduler implemented. Part of it is written in assembly and requires **GCC version 12**. This limitation may be resolved in future. But for now if you use older GCC buttons will not work properly.

For win users, you can use pre build version from [xpack project](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-elf-gcc-xpack/releases/tag/v12.2.0-3/)
