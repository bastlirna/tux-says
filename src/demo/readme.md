# HW Features Demo

This demo shows how to use the HW features of the board.

## TODO

- [x] Use ch32v003fun project as submodule
- [x] Compile and flash simple code
- [x] Use printf via SWIO
- [ ] Use printf via UTX (UART in prog. connector)
- [x] Setup GPIO to control LEDs
- [x] Setup GPIO to read buttons
- [x] Setup SysTick to count ms
- [x] Setup PWM to generate sound
- [ ] Deep speed mode wit wakeup from button
- [ ] Setup I2C for Shitty Add-On
- [ ] Implement sw PWM to control LEDs (control GPIO in interrupt from timer)
